<h1>CS361_Microservice_A_Random_Exercise_Image_Gen<h2>
<p>This microservice provides random exercise-related images which can be leveraged for various purposes. The structure of the microservice follows a simple logic. Once it is called, it routes to the subdirectory that houses approximately 75 exercise photos. Upon accessing the subdirectory, it will at random select one photo and return that image back to the requestor.</p>
